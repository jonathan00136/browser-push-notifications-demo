##### Optional environment variables

- `FLASK_DEBUG=1`
- `FLASK_PORT=8888`

### Production environment

#### Secure environment

You may only register the service workers in "safe" environments, basically `localhost` and `https` domains

> Service workers require secure origins to ensure that the service worker script is from the intended origin and hasnâ€™t come about from a man-in-the-middle attack. Currently, that means using HTTPS on live sites, though localhost will work during development

If you decide to use a self signed certificate, users will need to fully trust that certificate before being able to allow notifications.
